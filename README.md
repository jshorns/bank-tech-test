Specification

Requirements

You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)

Deposits, withdrawal.

Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.

Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

## Acceptance criteria

Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012
And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012
And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012
When she prints her bank statement
Then she would see

date || credit || debit || balance

14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00

13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00

10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00


## User stories

As a client,
so I can keep my money safe,
I want to be able to deposit my money in a bank account.

As a client,
so I can spend my money, 
I want to be able to withdraw my money from my account.

As a client,
so I can see how I'm using my money,
I want to be able to view my transaction history.

## Classes:

Account - knows how much money is stored in it. methods - deposit, withdraw, print_statement (will call a printing method on the statement class).
Transaction - knows when it was made, how much it was for (and whether it was + or -), knows what the bank balance was after. methods - .deposit? withdrawal?
Transaction history/statement - knows what transactions have been made.

## Design:

Assume bank accts are opened with a minimum starting deposit - Â£500? this can be a default constant so that it can be easily changed. (actually scratch this - requirements specify the history starts with an empty balance)
